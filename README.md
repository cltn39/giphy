# giphy!

An API based gif search engine.
## What I used

this API search engine was built using jQuery& Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and googlefont.

## Caution:

rating restriction is currently disabled. If keywords are not denied by gifphy API, result might show nsfw gif.

you can enable rating restriction by removing // in game.js line 18 & line 48.
