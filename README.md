# giphy!

An API based gif search engine.
## What I used

this API search engine was built using jQuery& Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and googlefont.

Data persistency was achieved by session storage.

##Additional features:
- you can now request addition gifs of same categories if you click same button twice.
- You can now get redirected to the original gif url and can download it 

## Caution:

rating restriction is now enabled. Now only will show ratings below pg_13
